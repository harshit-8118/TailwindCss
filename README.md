# TailwindCss
- There are two responsive one page websites designed using Tailwindcss
- I had used Tailwind css for design and Javascript for toggling navbar.
- These two short project helped me using tailwind on next level.
- I had read whole tailwind documentation, It was such a surprise to do the same with ease.
- I had used my knowledge and creativity for designing single page website using tailwind css only.
